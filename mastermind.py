'''Rules of Mastermind:
# The 'codemaker' chooses four 'pieces' from six 'colors'.
# At easy level, repeat colors are not allowed.
# At hard level, repeats and blanks are allowed.
# The 'codebreaker' guesses the four colors.
# The 'codemaker' reports how many pieces are in the correct position,
# and how many are a color that is present but not in the correct position.
